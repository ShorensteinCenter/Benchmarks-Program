					<div class="col">We store any data you enter in our secure database. Your name, organization name, and email address will be used to ensure that your data set actually belongs to a media or journalism organization. In addition, we may use your organization name to help compare your data set to that of other similar organizations. We will not publically report your name, organization name, email address, or any other identifying information you provide us with. Your API key will be used to access your MailChimp data. We do not request any personally identifying information about your list members (e.g. name, email address, etc.); list members are uniquely identified only by a md5-hashed version of their email address. We do not directly store the results of any of our API calls; instead we store the results of our calculations on this data which are usually averages across your entire list. Each set of results is associated with the API key you provided and the unique MailChimp ID of the list you asked us to analyze. We will use your API key to update these results from time to time, and we will use these results to help calculate a "Database Average" for other users of this tool. The MailChimp data we may access via API includes, but is not limited to, information about your lists and campaigns (list/campaign statistics, list/campaign creation dates, past list/campaign activity, etc.) and list members (list member subscription status, list member subscription status changes, list member recent activity, etc.).</div>
