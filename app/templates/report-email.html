	</p>
	<p style="font-family:Montserrat,Verdana,sans-serif;margin-bottom:2.5em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:1200px;">Chart A compares the total number of current subscribers on your list to the mean number of current subscribers across all lists we're tracking in our database. (This number may be slightly smaller than the number you're used to seeing as it does not include "Pending" email adddresses.) A better way of thinking about your list is taking into account the current status of every email address you’ve ever acquired (see Chart B, below).</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">
		<img style="min-width:400px;max-width:100%;" alt="Chart B: List Composition vs. Database Average (Mean)" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='charts/' + list_id + '_breakdown.png', _external=True) }}">
	</p>
	<p style="font-family:Montserrat,Verdana,sans-serif;margin-bottom:2.5em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:1200px;">Chart B breaks down the total number of unique email addresses in the entire list into percentages. In this case, the entire list refers to all email addresses ever acquired, both currently and formerly subscribed. MailChimp has four possible values for list member status: Subscribed (current subscribers), Unsubscribed, (subscribers who removed themselves from list or whom the list owner removed), Cleaned (subscribers removed from the list, typically by a service provider after email bounces) and Pending (semi-subscribers stuck in the limbo of double opt in—or, someone who gave their email address but did not hit the confirmation button in their email inbox).</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">
		<img style="min-width:400px;max-width:100%;" alt="Chart C: List Open Rate vs. Database Average (Mean)" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='charts/' + list_id + '_open_rate.png', _external=True) }}">
	</p>
	<p style="font-family:Montserrat,Verdana,sans-serif;margin-bottom:2.5em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:1200px;">Chart C shows your List Open Rate. MailChimp calculates List Open Rate by taking the mean of your past Campaign Open Rates over the life of your list. Each Campaign Open Rate is calculated by dividing the number of recipients who opened the campaign email by the number of emails delivered. For more information on how MailChimp calculates open rates, refer to <a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/email-analysis-research-guide#21_Inconsistently_Labeled_and_Defined_Email_Metrics" style="text-decoration:none;color:#a71930;">Section 2.1 of our Research Guide</a>. While List and Campaign Open Rates are the traditional way of looking at your email performance, these metrics lose a large part of the story. A better way to look at your List Open Rate is through a distribution of your subscribers' individual unique open rates (see Chart D, below).</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">
		<img style="min-width:400px;max-width:100%;" alt="Chart D: Distribution of User Unique Open Rates" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='charts/' + list_id + '_open_rate_histogram.png', _external=True) }}">
	</p>
	<p style="font-family:Montserrat,Verdana,sans-serif;margin-bottom:2.5em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:1200px;">Chart D shows the distribution of User Unique Open Rates for current subscribers on your list. (User Unique Open Rate is a MailChimp statistic calculated by dividing the total number of emails a user has opened by the total number of emails successfully delivered to him or her.) This histogram is created through binning, which groups together consecutive continuous numbers into discrete bins. The x axis shows the range that each bin contains. As an example, the leftmost bin contains subscribers with a User Unique Open Rate between 0% and 10%. The rightmost bin contains subscribers with a User Unique Open Rate between 90% and 100%. The y axis shows the percentage of current subscribers who fall into each bin. User Unique Open Rates generally trend downward before upticking between 80-100%. For a more comprehensive look at typical distributions, refer to <a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/email-analysis-research-guide#Notebook_1_Section_34_Subscriber_Engagement_Distributions" style="text-decoration:none;color:#a71930;">Section 3.4 of our Research Guide</a>.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">
		<img style="min-width:400px;max-width:100%;" alt="Chart E: Percentage of Subscribers with User Unique Open Rate >80% vs. Database Average (Mean)" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='charts/' + list_id + '_high_open_rt.png', _external=True) }}">
	</p>
	<p style="font-family:Montserrat,Verdana,sans-serif;margin-bottom:2.5em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:1200px;">Chart E shows your most engaged subscribers: those who open between 80% and 100% of your emails. These subscribers deserve greater scrutiny: what drives their activity? It is worth trying to figure out how to move more of your subscribers into this portion of your list.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">
		<img style="min-width:400px;max-width:100%;" alt="Chart F: Percentage of Subscribers who did not Open in last 365 Days vs. Database Average (Mean)" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='charts/' + list_id + '_cur_yr_inactive_pct.png', _external=True) }}">
	</p>
	<p style="font-family:Montserrat,Verdana,sans-serif;margin-bottom:2.5em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:1200px;">Chart F shows your current subscribers who haven't opened one of your emails within the past 365 days. Inactive subscribers can cloud your metrics and make it harder to understand your list dynamics.</p>
	<p style="font-family:Montserrat,Verdana,sans-serif;font-size:11px;color:#555;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:1200px;">Database Average is the mean figure across all lists in our data set. We acknowledge the frequency with which emails are sent can affect metrics, with daily sends having lower engagement than weekly or monthly sends.
